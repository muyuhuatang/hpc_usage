# Basic commands
1. running slurm script - "sbatch"
2. check currently running nodes - "squeue --me" "squeue -u {user_id}"
3. scancel currently running node - "scancel {job_id}"

# loading HPC modules
1. Load module - "module load {module_name}" "{module_name}=deeplearning" for deep learning modules

# remote forwarding
ssh -N -L {local_ip}:{local_port}:{remote_ip}:{remote_port} {remove_server}

In here, we need 2 hop forwarding
1 hop
	from HPC GPU node to local HPC
2 hop
	from local HPC to your local machine

Overall steps
1. open GPU node
	- this is done by slurm script
2. 1 hop forwarding
	- from HPC GPU node to local hPc
	- ex: ssh -N -L localhost:23456:localhost:8888 g22
2. 2 hopt forwarding
	- from your local computer to local hpc
	- ex: ssh -N -L localhost:23456:localhost:23456 xxx@carbonate.uits.iu.edu
	- essentially, the forwarding is 3333 (loccal computer) -> 23456 (local hpc) -> 8888 (gpu node)
